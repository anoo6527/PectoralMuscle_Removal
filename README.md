# PectoralMuscle_Removal
Image processing for Pectoral Muscle boundary detection

#  Background
Mammography is one of the most utilized method by radiologists for detection of
breast related diseases such as breast cancer, breast density, masses and
microcalcifications. Basic motivations behinds Computer-aided detection (CAD)
systems is to provide objective and more accurate information to reduce the rate
of misdiagnosis of breast cancer. CAD system also helps to provide correct view
of region of interest to the radiologists.

Mammographic views are further divided into three different regions known as
breast boundary, background, and pectoral muscle.

In this, we detect the pectoral muscle from the breast border using Canny edge detection, sobel filtering and hough transform.
